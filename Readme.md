Project Report: Genome Analysis and Variant Pathogenicity Prediction

1. Introduction
This project involves building a pipeline for analyzing genome data and predicting the pathogenicity (disease-causing potential) of genetic variants. The pipeline integrates multiple steps, from data preprocessing to variant annotation and machine learning-based pathogenicity prediction.
Objective
The primary goal is to create a streamlined and automated process for genome analysis that can:
Assemble genomic data.
Identify and annotate genetic variants.
Predict whether a genetic variant is likely to cause a disease.
2. Methodology
The project is divided into several stages, each simulating a real-world genome analysis workflow.
2.1. Data Preprocessing
Purpose: Converts raw sequencing data into a format suitable for analysis.
Key Task: Processes sequences and evaluates their quality.
Output: A table of sequences with quality scores, showing the number of sequences retained after preprocessing.
2.2. Genome Assembly
Purpose: Combines short sequences into longer, continuous genome fragments called contigs.
Key Task: Simulates assembling genomic sequences into three contigs.
Output: A list of contigs, including the longest one.
2.3. Assembly Quality Assessment
Purpose: Evaluates the quality of the assembled genome.
Key Metrics:
N50: Measures the length of contigs, favoring longer ones.
GC Content: Indicates the percentage of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) in the genome.
Output: A report summarizing the quality metrics.
2.4. Variant Calling
Purpose: Detects differences (variants) between the assembled genome and a reference genome.
Key Task: Simulates identifying five variants.
Output: A table of variants with details such as chromosome, position, and nucleotide changes.
2.5. Variant Annotation
Purpose: Adds biological significance to each variant, e.g., whether it affects gene function.
Key Task: Annotates variants with their effects, such as "missense" (changes protein function) or "synonymous" (no effect).
Output: A summary table with annotated variants and their categories.
2.6. Pathogenicity Prediction
Purpose: Uses a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of variants being disease-causing.
Key Features Used:
CADD_PHRED: A score predicting variant impact.
SIFT/PolyPhen: Scores assessing protein function impact.
Model Architecture: Combines two neural network types:
MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) for numerical features.
CNN-LSTM for sequential features.
Output: Predictions of pathogenicity probability (0 to 1).
3. Outputs and Their Significance

- **Explanation:**
  - This output represents the cleaned and processed genomic sequences.
  - Each sequence has an associated `quality_score`, indicating the reliability of the sequence data.
  - This is the input for further steps like assembly and analysis.

- **Explanation:**
  - Contigs are longer stretches of DNA assembled from smaller sequence fragments.
  - The output shows all assembled contigs and identifies the longest one, which is often a key metric for assembly success.

  GC content       0.45
  ```
- **Explanation:**
  - **N50**: Indicates the length of the smallest contig in the set that contains 50% of the total assembly length. Higher values suggest better assembly.
  - **L50**: The number of contigs needed to reach 50% of the total assembly length. Lower values indicate better assembly.
  - **Total length**: The cumulative length of all contigs.
  - **GC content**: The proportion of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases, useful for assessing genome composition.

  chr1  2000 C   G    synonymous
  ```
- **Explanation:**
  - **CHROM** and **POS**: Indicate the chromosome and position of the variant.
  - **REF** and **ALT**: Represent the reference and alternate alleles at the position.
  - **ANNOTATION**: Describes the functional impact of the variant:
    - **Missense**: A single nucleotide change that alters the protein.
    - **Synonymous**: A nucleotide change that doesnâ€™t affect the protein sequence.
    - Other annotations like **nonsense** or **intronic** may also appear.

---

### **5. Pathogenicity Prediction**
- **Example Output:**
  ```plaintext
  Predicted Probability Distribution: Benign: 80%, Pathogenic: 20%
  ```
- **Explanation:**
  - The model predicts whether a variant is **pathogenic** (disease-causing) or **benign**.
  - The output shows the probability distribution for all variants analyzed.
  - A higher pathogenic probability suggests greater confidence in the variant being disease-related.

---

### **6. Visualization Outputs**
- **Training History**:
  - **Example Graph**: Line plots showing loss and accuracy over epochs.
  - **Explanation**: 
    - Training loss and accuracy indicate how well the model learns from the data.
    - Validation metrics help assess performance on unseen data.

- **ROC Curve**:
  - **Example Graph**: A curve showing the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
  - **Explanation**:
    - AUC (Area Under Curve) quantifies model performance (1.0 is perfect, 0.5 is random).
    - A high AUC indicates effective discrimination between pathogenic and benign variants.

- **Confusion Matrix**:
  - **Example Matrix**:
    ```plaintext
    Predicted â†’  Benign  Pathogenic
    True â†“      
    Benign         95         5
    Pathogenic      4        96
    ```
  - **Explanation**:
    - True positives (correct pathogenic predictions) and true negatives (correct benign predictions) are along the diagonal.
    - Off-diagonal elements indicate errors (e.g., False Positives or False Negatives).

- **Predictions Distribution**:
  - **Example Graph**: Histogram of prediction probabilities.
  - **Explanation**:
    - The graph shows the spread of prediction probabilities for variants.
    - Clusters at extremes (0 or 1) indicate strong confidence in predictions.
